# JS Utils

## Abstract
I found myself repeatinf a lot of functions from project to project, like generating a random int or comparing values in an array. So this project is a collection of functions i found myself using across projects.

## Contributions
If you have functions you feel like are common throughout a lot of projects, feel free to add them to the project :)
